## Summary
**Goal:** Rebrand the clothing store application to "Narie" with a floral elegance theme, incorporating the new brand logo, motto, and refined visual identity.

**Planned changes:**
- Update application name to "Narie" throughout the frontend (HTML title, header, navigation)
- Add "Elegance in Floral" motto/tagline on homepage and header
- Integrate uploaded Narie brand logo (gold floral emblem with teal accent) in header, favicon, and hero section
- Update hero section heading to align with "Elegance in Floral" theme
- Refine color palette to incorporate gold tones and teal accents inspired by the logo while maintaining warm earth tones
- Generate new hero banner with floral motifs matching the brand aesthetic

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a cohesively rebranded "Narie" storefront with elegant floral branding, the new logo prominently displayed, and a refined color scheme featuring gold and teal accents that convey botanical sophistication.
