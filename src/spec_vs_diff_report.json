  "summary": "The diff implements all core rebranding requirements. The application name 'Narie' is updated throughout frontend files (index.html, Layout.tsx, HeroSection.tsx). The tagline 'Elegance in Floral' appears in both header and hero section. Logo images are integrated in header, hero, and favicon. The hero heading is updated to 'Where Elegance Blooms' which reflects the floral theme. Color system incorporates gold, teal, and cream tones via OKLCH values in index.css and custom Tailwind tokens. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the available diff evidence.",
